# Zypp Protocol: The Future of Onchain Transactions

![App Demo Screenshot](/public/og.png "Zypp Protocol")

## Project Name & Description
**Zypp Protocol** is the first **DropFi** (Drop Finance) protocol, enabling truly offline, peer-to-peer transfers of assets and data. Using Solana's durable nonces and secure device-to-device communication, Zypp allows users to "swipe-to-send" crypto, NFTs, or files directly between phonesâ€”no internet, no cloud, just seamless, secure, on-chain settlements.

## Vision / Goal
To make the physical proximity of devices the new network layer. We envision a world where connectivity is never a barrier to economic activity, enabling secure, instant, and decentralized value transfer anywhere on Earth. Zypp will become the default device-to-device sharing protocol for the Solana ecosystem, redefining how people share value in physical spaces.

## Features
- **Offline-First Transactions:** Send SOL, SPL tokens, and NFTs without internet using Bluetooth/NFC or WIFI.
- **Gesture-Based UX:** Intuitive "swipe-to-send" interaction for magical user experience
- **Durable Nonce Engine:** Leverages Solana's durable nonces to keep transactions valid for weeks
- **Cross-Platform SDK:** Developer tools to integrate DropFi capabilities into any mobile app
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Secure peer-to-peer communication for maximum privacy
- **Multi-Asset Support:** Files, tokens, and identity sharing in a single protocol

## Installation / Usage
