Zypp Protocol is the first **offline first crypto payment protocol** powered by **Solana**.  
It enables users to send and receive tokens, NFTs, or identity data without internet connectivity using **Bluetooth**, **NFC**, or **proximity based peer discovery**.  

With Zypp, users can transact, gift, and exchange assets seamlessly in real world offline environments. Once back online, all transactions automatically sync securely to Solana.

## 🚀 What is Zypp Protocol?

Zypp redefines **peer to peer finance** by enabling **true offline crypto interactions**.  
It combines proximity technology with on chain synchronization to make Solana accessible anywhere even when there is no Wi Fi or mobile data.  

Whether at a concert, in remote regions, or during network downtime, Zypp ensures that DeFi remains uninterrupted.

## 🧩 Key Features

**Offline Transactions**  
Send and receive assets using Bluetooth or NFC without an internet connection.  

**Proximity Drops**  
Instant value transfers between nearby devices using secure discovery mechanisms.  

**Gesture Based UX**  
Perform transactions with simple motions such as shake to send or swipe to accept.  

**End to End Encryption**  
Every transaction is locally encrypted, ensuring privacy and security in offline mode.  

**Auto Sync to Solana**  
All offline activity automatically syncs to the blockchain once the device reconnects to the internet.  

**Developer SDK**  
An open SDK for Solana developers to integrate offline transaction capabilities into their own apps and wallets.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Crypto payments rely heavily on constant internet access.  
In regions or scenarios where connectivity fails, financial systems stop functioning.  
Zypp eliminates this limitation by creating a **resilient decentralized layer** for offline value transfer.  

This unlocks a world of new use cases such as emergency payments, festival drops, local trading, or private peer exchanges.

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

Zypp uses a hybrid model combining local device communication and Solana’s high speed transaction layer.  

1. **Offline Layer**  
   Built with Bluetooth Low Energy, NFC, and encrypted local message queues.  

2. **Storage Layer**  
   Local caching with Realm and MMKV ensures fast access and transaction history retention.  

3. **Sync Layer**  
   Once connected to the internet, queued transactions are verified and pushed to Solana using the `@solana/web3.js` SDK.  

4. **Developer Integration Layer**  
   SDK hooks and APIs allow wallets, merchants, and dApps to embed offline functionality.

## 🔐 Security

Zypp prioritizes **user privacy and encryption**. Offline transactions are  
- Signed locally with cryptographic keys  
- Stored securely until confirmation  
- Verified through end to end encryption  

No data is ever transmitted in plaintext, ensuring anonymity and security even in peer to peer environments.
